The Gainesville Bus Tracker Android app was developed for a group project assignment for the Human Computer Interaction class (Spring 2015) at the University of Florida. Our group consisted of myself and two other students,Â Tianshuang Liu and Hengyu Chen. The goal of our project was to create an improved bus tracking app by adding additional search and route planning functionality.

The app is no longer available on the Google Play Store, but some screenshots can be seen below.
